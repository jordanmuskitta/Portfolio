### Project 1: ASX Announcement Sentiment Analysis

_Authors: Jordan Muskitta_

This project allowed me to develop my skills as a python programmer through creating an ASX Annoucement Scraper and Sentiment Analysis bot. I was able to work with new python libraries such as vader and Tika. This project helped ameliorate myself with NLP and machine learning principles.

### Project 2: Brixc Capstone Project

This project was my final capstone as a part of General Assembly's Data Analytics Immersive Course that was a part of an Australia Government initiative. In this Project I was required to analyse a real Australian start-ups data in order to find insights from their customer and revenue data. This was a great project to work on as it expanded my skill set and pushed my analytical thinking. I had to use many tools and languages in this project in order to wrangle, clean and present the data. This project showed me importance of time mangement and project planning, as well as how extensive and time consuming cleaning data can be. In this project I used a mix of Python, MySQL and Tableau.

### Project Objectives:

- Find one subscription insight
- Find one growth/revenue insight
- Find customer churn rate
- Find customer lifetime value 

### Project 3: Facial Recognition

I want to explore deep and machine learning. In order to learn the basic of Convolutional Neural Networks, I decided to experiment with OpenCV. OpenCV is an opensource computer vision library that is available for python. I want to incorporate this facial recognition program to an artwork that I am currently developing.

### Project Objectives:

- Make a program that can detect face in real time


### Project 4: Tesla Stock Price Analysis
