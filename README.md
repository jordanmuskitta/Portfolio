### Project 1: ASX Announcement Sentiment Analysis

_Authors: Jordan Muskitta_

This project allowed me to develop my skills as a python programmer through creating an ASX Annoucement Scraper and Sentiment Analysis bot. I was able to work with new python libraries such as vader and Tika. This project helped ameliorate myself with NLP and machine learning principles.
